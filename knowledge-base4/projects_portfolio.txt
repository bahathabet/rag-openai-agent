project portfolio and case studies
we are working on 8 projects as the following:
completed projects such as:
1- Smartgrid Emilia project: completed in 2023, the Smartgrid Emilia project represented a groundbreaking collaboration with the regional energy authority of emilia-romagna to modernize the electrical distribution network across twelve municipalities. our team developed an ai-powered grid management system that integrated renewable energy sources with traditional power generation facilities. the project involved deploying over 2,000 iot sensors throughout the electrical infrastructure and creating machine learning models that could predict energy demand fluctuations with 94% accuracy. the implementation phase required extensive coordination with local utility companies and municipal governments. our engineers worked closely with electrical technicians to ensure seamless integration of smart monitoring devices without disrupting existing services. the ai algorithms we developed could automatically balance load distribution, reducing energy waste by 31% and improving grid stability during peak consumption periods. the project resulted in annual savings of €2.3 million for the regional energy authority and became a model for similar initiatives across italy.
2- predictive maintenance system for ferrari production lines: in 2022, we partnered with ferrari's manufacturing division to develop an advanced predictive maintenance system for their production facilities in maranello. this high-profile project involved analyzing telemetry data from precision manufacturing equipment used in luxury vehicle production. our team created sophisticated machine learning models that could predict equipment failures up to 72 hours before they occurred, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling that minimized production disruptions. the system monitored over 150 critical manufacturing components using advanced sensor networks and real-time data processing. our ai algorithms analyzed vibration patterns, temperature fluctuations, and operational parameters to identify subtle indicators of impending mechanical issues. the implementation resulted in a 47% reduction in unplanned downtime and improved overall equipment effectiveness by 23%. ferrari reported significant improvements in production quality consistency and reduced maintenance costs, leading to an expanded partnership for additional manufacturing optimization projects.
3- intelligent fraud detection for banco popolare: our cybersecurity team developed a comprehensive fraud detection system for banco popolare, one of italy's largest banking institutions. completed in 2023, this project involved analyzing millions of transaction records to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. we created ensemble machine learning models that combined multiple detection algorithms, achieving a 99.2% accuracy rate while reducing false positives by 65% compared to the bank's previous system. the project required integration with existing banking infrastructure and compliance with strict financial regulations. our team worked within the bank's secure environment, implementing advanced encryption and privacy protection measures. the ai system could process real-time transactions and flag suspicious activities within milliseconds, enabling immediate intervention when necessary. the implementation prevented an estimated €15 million in fraudulent transactions during its first year of operation.
4- supply chain optimization for barilla group: we completed a comprehensive supply chain optimization project for barilla group, italy's largest pasta manufacturer, in late 2022. this initiative involved developing ai-powered demand forecasting and inventory management systems that could predict consumer demand across multiple product lines and geographic markets. our algorithms analyzed historical sales data, seasonal patterns, economic indicators, and social media sentiment to create highly accurate demand forecasts. the system optimized warehouse operations, transportation logistics, and production scheduling across barilla's european operations. machine learning models identified optimal inventory levels for different products and locations, reducing carrying costs while ensuring product availability. the implementation resulted in a 19% reduction in inventory costs and improved customer satisfaction through better product availability. barilla extended our partnership to include additional facilities in north america.
5- smart city initiative for municipality of parma: our most ambitious local project involved developing a comprehensive smart city platform for the municipality of parma. completed in 2023, this initiative integrated multiple urban systems including traffic management, waste collection, public lighting, and environmental monitoring. we created an integrated ai platform that could optimize city services while improving quality of life for residents. the traffic management component used computer vision and machine learning to analyze vehicle and pedestrian flows, automatically adjusting signal timing to reduce congestion. our waste management optimization system used iot sensors and predictive analytics to optimize collection routes and schedules. the environmental monitoring network provided real-time air quality data and early warning systems for pollution events. the comprehensive implementation improved traffic flow efficiency by 28% and reduced municipal operational costs by €1.8 million annually.
